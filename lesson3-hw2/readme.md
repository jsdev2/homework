##### Homework

(due before class Monday, May 9, to jsdevhomework@gmail.com)

*Problem 1: 99 Bottles of Beer on the wall*

* Make a JavaScript script that prints the lyrics to 99 bottles of beer on the wall. Take into account the singular and plural versions of “beer” and “beers”.

* For reference: http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html

*Problem 2: Generate random addresses!*

* Create new arrays containing dummy data for Street, City, State.
* Now each time you run the script, it should print new randomly generated address from the arrays and random numbers for street numbers and zip codes. 
* For example:
  * `node random-address.js`
  * `=> 34578 Dolphin Street, Wonka NY, 44506`

* As a bonus, randomly include an apartment number (so sometimes an address has an apartment while others do not).
